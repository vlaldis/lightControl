# Light control using person/car detection

I'm pissed by motion sensor triggered by cats, birds and hedgehogs. Lights are going crazy during night.

I'll be using security camera to switch on lights when **person** OR **car** is detected.

Solution is designed to run on Nvidia Jetson Nano due to its computing abilities.


## Why?
**Because Why NOT?**
